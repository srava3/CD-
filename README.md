Title: Patron Defection Data Analysis
The modern business environment presents service providers with increasing competition as well as changing customer preferences, which makes it imperative to lower customer churn—the phenomenon when customers stop doing business with a company. This research investigates the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques for churn prediction in a range of businesses, highlighting the necessity of keeping current customers in the face of growing markets and rising acquisition prices. Among the well-known approaches examined are ensemble methods, K-nearest neighbors, neural networks, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, and gradient boosted trees. Furthermore, it emphasizes how crucial feature engineering is to improving churn prediction models by obtaining relevant consumer information including usage patterns, transaction histories, and demographics. By implementing these techniques, service providers can proactively.
